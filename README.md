Home Page (Main Menu)

For the home page, I decided to take some inspiration from existing e-commerce websites. I borrowed ideas from websites like Carousell and Shopee in how they present their home page. It takes you directly to the main selling point of the website. I want the customer to be able to be taken directly to why they are visiting the website in the first place. To buy my products. In the home page, I have included in a search feature in there as I feel like it should be a basic feature in an e-commerce website. Then below, I have made a few examples of how the products that I’m selling will be marketed like. The -> arrow on the right side will be able to slide vertically to show more products. I have included in a footer to show the basic information to show if a customer wants to know more about the company and social media links.


Product Page

For the product page, I decided to stick to a basic and direct page. It shows what it needs to show and not much of anything else. The page is very compact and you wont need to scroll on the page. I intend to add a feature on the description where your scroll if you want to keep reading it. The search feature will still be on the page and the footer too.


Buy Page

Lastly, for the buy page, I took inspiration from Aftershock in how they show their checkout page. I felt that it was very clear and concise on how they show your purchases that you’ve added to the cart and how much every item is, not hiding any hidden costs too. The personal information will include in a box in which you can type in your information. The country option will have a dropdown feature for the user to select their country. It’s basically the same thing for the payment information too.
